# A City for Students
Data collection project for MSc Social Data Science in collaboration with Gehl Architects.
## Purpose
My data collection project focused on answering the question of examining how students see their immediate neighbourhoods as a way to investigate how an ideal neighbourhood would look like for them. It aims to provide a perspective to the ongoing development in Nordhavn, Copenhagen, relating to the concept of 15-minute cities.

## Findings
The main findings of the study include that students are more drawn to green spaces and identify them, as well as other facilities, such as grocery stores and libraries, being important to be close by, and dislike noisy areas as well as places beyond the human scale.
